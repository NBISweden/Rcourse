<p>If you are eager to try things out before the course starts the
following links goes to some useful material on using R.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf">Best first R tutorial</a>
A nice self learn tutorial to R, introducing many central concepts to R.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf">A short introduction to R</a>
A very short intro to using R.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html">An introduction to R</a>
A fairly comprehensive document on R. As a beginner one can start
with Appendix A that is a short practical session.</li>
  <li><a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/NSPpart.pdf">The art of R programming</a>
A pdf copy of a book that deals with R as a programming
language. Is a great source of information for anyone that wants to
use R not only as a statistical analysis tools, but also use it as a
more general programming language.</li>
  <li><a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz">R for data science</a>
The basics of getting data into R, clean the data do your
analysis. One of the authors of this book Hadley Wickham is also
behind R-studio and has published several books on different aspects
of using R, many of them available for free via his web page. He has
also created many packages for R that facilitate structured data
analysis. His most popular packages is ggplot2 for creating beautiful
graphics with limited set of commands. This is one of the few
external packages that we will use more extensively in
class. Besides ggplot2 he has created many other packages that make
use of novel objects and often use slightly different R syntax to
interact with them. This means that code using them will look
different to most other R code. If you like this way of working,
there is a whole set of packages often referred to as
the <a href="https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0">tidyverse</a>
that offers a more unified interaction with objects and functions
under this approach to data analysis.</li>
  <li><a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help">R-help mailing list</a>
List of R-help mailing lists, where one often can find hints and
solutions to commonly occuring problems. Please read the posting
guide carefully before publishing any questions</li>
