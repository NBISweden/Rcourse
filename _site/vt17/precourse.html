	<main>
          <h1 id="pre-course-material">Pre-course Material</h1>

<p>You are not required to have any experience with the R language nor
with the software R-studio to follow the course, but to save time and
get a smooth start we ask everyone to have the latest version of R and
R studio installed on your computer at course start.</p>

<h1 id="software-needed-for-the-course">Software needed for the course</h1>

<p>For the course we will use the latest version of R and R-studio. Both
of these works on computers running Linux, Windows and Macintosh
operative systems. R-studio is both a set of tools and an editor that
facilitates the use of R and in many ways create a superior computing
environment that integrates directly with R. Over the last years it has
become a very popular tool and has for many become the standard way of
interacting with R.</p>

<p>Note that on same operative systems it will be easier to install and
run R and R-studio if you have an administrator account on your
computer and hence are allowed to install software on your machine. If
you do not have these privileges please ask your system administrator
to install the latest version of R and R-studio.</p>

<h2 id="install-r">Install R</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com">CRAN</a></li>
  <li>Click on the link corresponding to your operative system</li>
  <li>Download the recommended files for your system.</li>
  <li>Run the installer or move the downloaded files to suitable place on
your computer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="details-for-windows">Details for Windows</h3>

<p>Once you clicked on the “Download R for Windows” you will come to a
new web page where you will have a set of options. Click on the first
link named “base”. This will take you to the web page entitled “R-3.4.1
for Windows” where you can download the “R-3.4.1-win.exe”
that will can be run to install R on your computer.</p>

<h3 id="details-for-macintosh">Details for Macintosh</h3>

<p>Once you clicked on the “Download R for Macintosh” you will come to a
new web page where you will have a set of options. Unless you have an
old version of your operative system you should select the first link
named “R-3.4.1.pkg” that will download R to your computer. If you are
not sure what version you are running click the apple on the top left
of your screen and select “About this mac” (Om den här datorn). In
case you are running something older than 10.9, you should instead
pick the “R-3.2.1-snowleopard.pkg” to install. Note that this will not
give you the latest version of R, but it will be sufficient for most
sections of the course.</p>

<p>You can then double-click the downloaded package that will prompt you
with some questions for installation details. Stick with the default
settings and you should be fine.</p>

<h3 id="details-for-linux">Details for Linux</h3>

<p>Once you clicked on the “Download R for Linux” you will come to a
new web page where you can select the linux version you use. On most
distributions this will be via a software install system like yum or
apt-get. If you run this make sure that you update your information to
the installer first, otherwise you might end up installing at outdated
version of R. For some systems you might need to install not only
r-base, but also r-devel or you will lack important features of your R
installation.</p>

<h2 id="install-r-studio">Install R-studio</h2>

<p>Go to the
web page <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">rstudio</a>
download the installer corresponding to your operative system. Unpack
the installer and install the app on a suitable place on your system.</p>

<h2 id="test-your-environment">Test your environment</h2>

<p>If the installation above went without any problem you should be able
to fire up R-studio and see something like the following:
<img src="../img/R-studio.png" style="width:400px;" /></p>

<p>If you do not see a screen like this one please send an email to
thomas.kallman@nbis.se describing the error together with the name of
your operative system and version of R/R-studio that you are trying to
install.</p>

<h1 id="other-tools">Other tools</h1>

<p>To be able to follow in this class we do recommend to use R-studio,
but in case it does not fit your needs all the R code we describe will
of course work irrespective of the environment that you work with. The main
benefits of using r-studio is that there are bundled packages with
this software that greatly helps for documenting the R-code that you
use and write.</p>

<p>While this is NOT absolutely necessary, the explanatory programming
approach we are using in the course will be easier to follow if you
have a distribution of LaTeX system installed on your machine so that
the R-Studio can call it. Please follow guidelines on
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/get/">LaTeX site</a></p>

<p>Mac users can follow <a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html">this link</a>
and installation instructions therein.</p>

<p>Some commonly used tools besides R-studio are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The built in GUI that comes with R.
Gives the basic functionality and if you are not a heavy R users
this might be suitable as it comes with the R package.</li>
  <li>ESS, emacs speaks statistics. If you are already using emacs this
offers nice possibities to interact with R from emacs. It offers
nice debugging features as well as support for building packages.</li>
  <li>Any text editor that you are happy with. This means that you can focus on
writing your code and then just run the code from within R using
copy/paste or by submitting all your code as scripts to R.</li>
</ul>
