# Useful R online resources

If you are eager to try things out before the course starts the
following links goes to some useful material on using R.

- [Best first R tutorial](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf)
  A nice self learn tutorial to R, introducing many central concepts to R.
- [A short introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf)
  A very short intro to using R.
- [An introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)
  A fairly comprehensive document on R. As a beginner one can start
  with Appendix A that is a short practical session.
- [The art of R programming](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/NSPpart.pdf)
  A pdf copy of a book that deals with R as a programming
  language. Is a great source of information for anyone that wants to
  use R not only as a statistical analysis tools, but also use it as a
  more general programming language.
- [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)
  The basics of getting data into R, clean the data do your
  analysis. One of the authors of this book Hadley Wickham is also
  behind R-studio and has published several books on different aspects
  of using R, many of them available for free via his web page. He has
  also created many packages for R that facilitate structured data
  analysis. His most popular packages is ggplot2 for creating beautiful
  graphics with limited set of commands. This is one of the few
  external packages that we will use more extensively in
  class. Besides ggplot2 he has created many other packages that make
  use of novel objects and often use slightly different R syntax to
  interact with them. This means that code using them will look
  different to most other R code. If you like this way of working,
  there is a whole set of packages often referred to as
  the [tidyverse](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0)
  that offers a more unified interaction with objects and functions
  under this approach to data analysis.
- [R-help mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help)
  List of R-help mailing lists, where one often can find hints and
  solutions to commonly occuring problems. Please read the posting
  guide carefully before publishing any questions

# R-studio Cheat sheets

- [Using R studio](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf)

# R game
If you want to test your skills and hopefully have some fun at the same time, you can play an R game. To do this,
<pre>
install.packages("BetaBit")
library('BetaBit')
</pre>
and choose one of the three available games. For instance, to play the proton game (which we recommend), you type:
<pre>
proton()
</pre>
Then just follow instructions on your screen. Let us know if you complete the game! Good luck!

# Useful Non-R specific online resources

- [Biostars/](http://www.biostars.org)
  Online Question and answer resource aimed at bioinformatics
